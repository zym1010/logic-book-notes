    "in the end of this section, the author is fussy about the difference of $\\mathbb{N}^2$ and $\\mathbb{N},\\mathbb{N}$. I really don't see the point of many-place function if we also the domain of a one-place function to be like $\\mathbb{N}^2$.\n",

    "You may argue that you cannot use a notation with a form similar to $\\mathbb{N}^2$ to represent a two-place function that takes natural number in the first argument and real number in the second, or $\\mathbb{N},\\mathbb{R}$. However, this is just some notational issue. We can devise some neat notation to represent this mixed 2D space in theory."
