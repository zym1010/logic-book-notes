    "> Our arguments for incompleteness came in two flavours. First, we combined the premiss (a) that we are dealing with a sound theory with the premiss (b) that our theory's language is expressively rich enough. Second, we weakened one assumption and beefed up the other: in other words, we used the weaker premiss (a') that we are dealing with a consistent theory but added the stronger premiss (b') that our theory can prove enough facts. We'll see that Gödel’s arguments too come in these two flavours.\n",
