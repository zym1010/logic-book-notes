The claim is only that the semantics effectively tells us the conditions under which a given sentence is true; it doesn’t at all follow that there is an effective way of telling whether those conditions actually hold and whether the sentence really is true.\n",

    "I think here \"effectively\" means that if we know the truth values of conditions that are associated with a sentence's truth value, then we can effectively determine the truth value of that sentence. How we get the truth values of those associated conditions is another matter. I think there should be some technical specifications on how we specify those conditions. For example, \"$s$ is true iff $s$ is true\" definitely is not good; but I'm not sure how to use formal language to remove them.\n",
