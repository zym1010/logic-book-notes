    "\n",
    "such treatment is consistent with the way how induction is used in standard math for proving relations. Check pp. 59-60 \"Induction and relations\". Basically, to prove that a relation for all $x,y$ holds, we induce on $x$ for any arbitrary $y$. \n",
    "\n",
    "With this \"induce on one and all others to be arbitrary\" strategy, now it's easy to understand 12.3, such as Proof for (4) in pp. 86. There, \"generalizing\" means using generalization rule (if you prove $\\phi(x)$, then $\\forall x \\phi(x)$).\n",

    "1. Overall, you want to prove $\\forall w \\psi (w)$. This way, by substituting $w$ with $u$, you get $u \\leq u \\rightarrow \\ldots$. the left side is always true, and so right side, which is what we want to prove, holds.\n",
    "2. For basecase (i) or $\\psi(0)$.\n",
    "    1. the left side $0 \\leq u$ is true due to O1 in 11.3 (with $x$ in O1 replaced with arbitrary term; see (1.3.0.7) of [Mathematical Logic and Model Theory](https://doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4471-2176-3)).\n",
    "    2. The right side, given $\\alpha$ is provable, or $(\\forall x \\leq u) \\exists y \\phi(x,y)$, we certainly can also prove $(\\forall x \\leq 0) \\exists y \\phi(x,y)$ as $0 \\leq u$, and there must be a term $t$ so that $(\\forall x \\leq 0)  \\phi(x,t)$ and furthermore $(\\forall x \\leq 0) ( \\exists y  \\leq t)  \\phi(x,y)$. so we can set $v=t$ to have $\\exists v (\\forall x \\leq 0) ( \\exists y  \\leq v)  \\phi(x,y)$. Notice that, here I understand it as standard math proof, as I believe $I\\Sigma_1$ should be able to prove all standard math as long as it doesn't involve induction.\n",
    "3. For induction case (ii), you should take $v=\\max(a,b)$ so that for any $x \\leq Sw$, we can resolve to one of the two assumptions (second one for $Sw$ and first for all other). Again, I understand it in the standard math sense, which I assume should work in this deduction system.\n",
