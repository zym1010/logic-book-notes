Otherwise, $\\phi$ plus axioms in $Q$ definitely won't be consistent, as we will be able to derive $\\phi$ and $\\neg \\phi$, which is contradiction. By GÃ¶del's completeness theorem, \"$\\neg \\phi$ not provable\" means that $\\phi$ plus axioms in $Q$ has a model (assuming $Q$ is consistent).\n",
    "\n",
    "The note at the end of this page is messy. I think they can remove \"we'd have a method for deciding whether Q is consistent (take $\\phi$ to be a contradiction)\". I think the intention of checking Q's consistency is to make sure we can use Thm 11.6 in the next sentence (\"and hence a method for deciding the truth or falsity of any ...\"). However, Thm 11.6 assumes soundness, which is stronger than consistency.\n",
    "\n",
    "Also, as you talk about truth or falsity of arithmetic sentences, I think you implicitly assumed that Q has the standard arithmetic as a model, and all the argument about Q's soundness simply follows. So there's no need to check Q's consistency. As long as you want to check some arithmetic sentences' truth values, you automatically make Q sound (and thus consistent).\n",
