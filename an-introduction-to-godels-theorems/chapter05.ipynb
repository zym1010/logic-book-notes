    "# 5.2 the language $L_A$\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## pp. 37 there is no single language of arithmetic.\n",
    "\n",
    "> There is no single language which could reasonably be called the language for formal arithmetic: rather, there is quite a variety of different languages, apt for framing theories of different strengths.\n",
    "\n",
    "In pp. 38, they define functions (successor, addition, multiplication), terms, etc. What's called \"predicate\" here is called relation in the model theory book [Mathematical Logic and Model Theory](https://doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4471-2176-3)\n",
    "\n",
    "pp. 39 talks about semantics. A few words about point 4, about the definition of $\\exists$ and $\\forall$ sentences.\n",
    "\n",
    "> I think in the model theory book, they use iff for some number $n$, $\\phi(n)$ is true, NOT $\\phi(\\overline{n})$. \n",
    ">\n",
    "> in this book, using $\\overline{n}$ is fine, as we can recursively define the truth value of this sentence using its components, and  set of $\\overline{n}$ is effectively the same as set of $n$.\n",
    ">\n",
    "> Basically, since set of $\\overline{n}$ is equal to set of $n$ (normally, the former should be always a subset of latter, as we always assign every term to some actual number, but not reverse), we can use either of them to cover all cases (all interpreted values) that a variable can take.\n",

    "# 5.4 Expressing numerical properties and functions\n",
    "\n",
    "## pp. 42 so there are multiple representations of the same property or relation.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Let's highlight again that 'expressing' in our sense is just a matter of getting the extension right. ... \n",
    "> Hence, we might say, $\\phi(x)$'s expressing $P$ in our sense can really only be a necessary condition for its expressing that property in the more **intuitive sense** of having the right meaning.\n",
    "\n",
    "I think **intuitive** means that $\\phi$ is not redundant, etc, such as having  $\\theta$ --- so that we can read off that meaning easily from the form of $\\phi(x)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "> By constrat, our notion is sharply defined.\n",
    "\n",
    "I think here \"notion\" means this particular way of defining property and relation. Sharply defined means it's very precise (although such way of defining inherently allows some freedom on the exact form of $\\phi(x)$).\n",
    "\n",
    "## pp. 43 Thm 5.1\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, $c_P(m) = 0$ means that $m$ satisfies this property. this is GÃ¶del's convention as mentioned before.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 5.5 Capturing numerical properties and functions\n",
    "\n",
    "## pp. 43 \"capture\" works for inconsistent theory as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "> notice that it's not iff, but \"if, ... then\". So a $T$ that proves everything (inconsistent) also captures.\n",
    "\n",
    "## pp. 44 the wffs that \"capture\" a property may be very unintuitive.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Hence, we might say, $\\phi(x)$'s capturing $P$ in our initial sense is just a necessary condition for its capturing that property in the more intuitive sense of proving wffs with the right meaning. But again the intuitive notion is murky, and our sharply defined notion will serve our purposes.\n",
    "\n",
    "basically, under current definition, a math property may be captured by something really confusing and hard to understand in the formal language. But this is not an issue for our study here.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## pp. 44 capture function is more complicated than you think.\n",
    "\n",
    "> It turns out, though, that it is useful to require a little more than that, and the story gets a bit complicated. However, as we won't actually need an official story about capturing functions until Chapter 16, we can usefully shelve further discussion until then.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 5.6 Expressing vs. capturing: keeping the distinction clear\n",
    "\n",
    "> 1. whether P is expressible in a given theory just depends on the richness of that theory's language;\n",
    "> 2. whether a property P can be captured by the theory depends on the richness of its axioms and proof system.\n",
    "\n",
    "So point 1 depends on the language (including its interpretation). point 2 more depends on the proof system.\n",
    "\n",
    "## pp. 45 express vs. capture for a sound theory.\n",
    "\n",
    "> if $\\phi(x)$ captures P in the sound theory T, then $\\phi(x)$ expresses P."
