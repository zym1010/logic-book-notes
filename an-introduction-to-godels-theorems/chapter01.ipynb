    "2. one way to make these statements' answers concrete, is to start from some axioms and then deduce every statement from them.\n",

    "\n",
    "1. Gödel comes up with some mathematical statement $G_T$ about natural numbers that can be proved to be not deducible from axioms. For some discussons on how we can recognize that $G_T$ must be true, see Section 23.2: overall, there are some perfectly reasonable arguments for $G_T$ to be true and yet they cannot be formalized in (first-order) $T$. I don't understand it right now. Should read more to understand this subtlety better.\n",
    "    > (i) we can show that $G_T$ can't be derived in $T$, and yet (ii) we can recognize that $G_T$ must be true. ... the truths of basic arithmetic must elude our attempts to pin them down by giving a nice set of fundamental assumptions from which we can deduce everything else.\n",
    "2. Overall, $G_T$ must be true. This argument depends on the assumptions that 1) $T$ is sound, so it can't prove falsehood, 2) $G_T$ is true (using some reasonable arguments not captured by $T$) if and only if it cannot be proved by $T$.\n",
    "    > Suppose then that $T$ is sound. If $T$ were to prove $G_T$ , $G_T$ would be false, and $T$ would then prove a falsehood, which it can't do. Hence, if $T$ is sound, $G_T$ is unprovable in $T$. Which makes $G_T$ true. Hence $\\neg G_T$ is false. And so that too can’t be proved by $T$, because $T$ only proves truths. In sum, still assuming $T$ is sound, neither $G_T$ nor its negation will be provable in $T$. Therefore $T$ can't be negation-complete.\n",
    "3. We don't need $T$ to be sound for our main conclusions. Conclusion (1) that $G_T$ cannot be proved only needs consistency of $T$, and conclusion (2) that $\\neg G_T$ cannot be proved needs something stronger.\n",
    "    > $T$'s mere consistency is enough to guarantee that a suitably constructed $G_T$ is true-but-unprovable-in-$T$. And we only need a little more to show that $\\neg G_T$ is not provable either.\n",
    "4. **Incompletable**. Adding (nicely) more axioms won't help. Here \"nicely\" means that we cannot \"cheat\" by, say, adding ALL statements of natural numbers to be axioms. Roughly speaking, we need to have a \"nice\" axiom system that we can reason about using finite or countable approaches.\n",
    "    > By contrast, what gives Gödel's First Theorem its real bite is that it shows that any nicely axiomatized and sound theory of basic arithmetic must remain incomplete, however many new true axioms we give it."

Because somehow we can show these two interpretations to be equivalent (not sure only using $T$ or using some additional \"reasonable math arguments\"), this ambiguity (meaning two things) does not really matter.\n",

And that is Gödel's Second Incompleteness Theorem. Roughly interpreted: nice theories that include enough basic arithmetic can't prove their own consistency.\n",
